# sectionHeaderTestDelete
a test project for stackoverflow question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64128143/how-to-delete-sectionheader-in-a-uicollectionview                                  not solved

Not Solved:
1. delete until 0 sections
2. add 1 section
3. delete section
4. crash - "Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: 'Invalid section 0."

another issue is If the app starts off with no data then you add data, nothing shows for the collectionview
